# Ride-My-Way [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IyiKuyoro/Ride-My-Way.svg?branch=API)](https://travis-ci.org/IyiKuyoro/Ride-My-Way)
A carpooling web application.

This is a simple web application that helps users find riders or drivers typically going in the same direction as them.
Drivers can add ride offers, riders can view and request rides and drivers can accept or decline or accept rider requests.

It is created as part of my Andela Nigeria Fellowship Cycle 33 Bootcamp Developer Challenge.
